# Youtube-streamer-and-downloader
This is a program that allows one to stream and download videos from YouTube, using pafy. I am going to use this to stream music, and build a general music player much like the discord "dabot".

# Requirements
You will need to install pafy, and youtube-dl. This can be done by the following commands:

pip3 install pafy
pip3 install youtube-dl
